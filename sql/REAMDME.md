# SQL database

This application uses sqlite3 for database.
You do not need to alter the database directly, since everything is done with
API endpoints in the application.
However, you can access the database directly by installing and using sqlite3 from
your terminal if you want to.

If you want to create a clean database, copy and paste the text from create.sql
to sqlite3.
If you want to delete the test data, copy and paste the text from delete.sql.
If you want to insert the test data, copy and paste the text from insert.sql.
